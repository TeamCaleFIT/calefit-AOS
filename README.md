# Calefit

Make your own exercise planner and share it with your firends.

Calefit is mainly composed of modern android architecture, MVVM, flow, room, and databinding.

Foundation - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for multidex and automated testing.
AppCompat - Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android.
Android KTX - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
Architecture - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data persistence.
Data Binding - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
Lifecycles - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
Room - Access your app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
ViewModel - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
Hilt - for dependency injection
Retrofit - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
